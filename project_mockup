Breakfast & Bed

Classes:
	Players, rooms, items, MOBs, Interface

Players can:
	move, pick up, put down, interact with room

Rooms can:
	hold items

Items can:
	affect players

-Players are MOBs who are controlled by interface rather than on their own?

-Maybe rooms exist on x, y coordinate plane. NESW corresponds to x and y change?

-Rooms should know what MOBs/players are in them

-Interface is given a player reference and issues commands to it? (most iffy idea)

Players have:
	name, inventory, legal restaurant

Rooms (can) have:
	players, inventory, MOBs

-obstacles, deliveries, dodging, limited turns
-pizza, grapes, spaghetti, apple, breakfast (egg), mattress
-money, fired, small spaghetti restaurant, mattress store
-wage based on number of turns
-opportunity to start own business
-delivery capacity
